        - ReadableAttributes and WritableAttributes added as methods to Record.pm

0.78 Jan 16 2003
        - SB->Count should return no results unless the search is limited
        - Eliminate a warning on empty searches

0.77 Jan 15 2003

        - No longer attempt to cache (and fail) objects that haven't been database-loaded

0.76 Dec 30 2002
        - Extra checking for cache misses in DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable
        - The start of support for checking database version, so that we can do 
          version-specific SQL
        - A patch from Autrijus Tang that allows utf-8 safe searching

0.75 Dec 06 2002
        - Applying a patch from Rob Spier <rspier@pobox.com> which enables
          arbitrarily complex grouping clauses. It's a hack, but we love it 
          anyway....at least until SB gets redone with proper arbitrarily 
          complex query generation.

0.31  Say May 12 14:45:00 EDT 2001
	- SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable now constructs cache keys in a way
	  that doesn't lose when records in different tables have the same keys.


0.30  Fri May 11 14:59:17 EDT 2001
        - Added DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable from <mhat@netlag.com>

          query has been performed
