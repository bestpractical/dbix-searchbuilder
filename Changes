1.02_02 Tue Jul 20 13:06:06 EDT 2004
        - Fixed a join bug that mostly manifests as a 'Dependency chain'
          error on RT2.

1.02_01 Wed Jul  7 12:28:08 EDT 2004
        - magic _Object instantiation from cubic@acronis.ru

1.01    Sun Jun 27 23:35:46 EDT 2004

        - Releasing 1.00_06 as stable

1.00_06 - Pg/Oracle: Don't attempt to do case insensitive comparisons on
          integer values.

1.00_05 - Force utf8 flag on when doing searches for utf8 data; this
          is a workaround for DBDs that don't do it themselves.

1.00_04	- Move Postgres specific join behaviour to the superclass so 
	  everyone gets the benefit.

1.00_03 - Remove "AS" from table name aliases on joins, since Oracle
          doesn't like em.

	- Proper support for query paging on SQLite
		
0.99	- Bundled changes from 0.98* and released production version

        - Changed DBIx::SB::Record::Cachable to expire cached object when a "deeper" method call changes their values

0.86 June 7 2003
        - Doing conditional connections was failing on postgres, because the handle was defined, but not connected

0.85 June 7 2003

0.75 Dec 06 2002
        - Applying a patch from Rob Spier <rspier@pobox.com> which enables
          arbitrarily complex grouping clauses. It's a hack, but we love it

          complex query generation.
