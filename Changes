Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::SearchBuilder.

0.76 Dec 30 2002
        - Extra checking for cache misses in DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable
        - The start of support for checking database version, so that we can do 
          version-specific SQL
        - A patch from Autrijus Tang that allows utf-8 safe searching

0.75 Dec 06 2002
        - Applying a patch from Rob Spier <rspier@pobox.com> which enables
          arbitrarily complex grouping clauses. It's a hack, but we love it 
          anyway....at least until SB gets redone with proper arbitrarily 
          complex query generation.

        - Adding support for mysqlPP

0.73 Sep 10 2002
        - More class-returnvalue ification
        - Fixed a caching bug that caused multiple copies of an object in memory to not 
          be kept in sync

0.72  Aug 28 2002
        - Fixed bug in setting a column to the value of an SQL statement.

        - Minor cleanups and refactorings to allow percolation of errors on create

0.31  Say May 12 14:45:00 EDT 2001
	- SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable now constructs cache keys in a way
	  that doesn't lose when records in different tables have the same keys.


0.30  Fri May 11 14:59:17 EDT 2001
        - Added DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record::Cachable from <mhat@netlag.com>
        - Changed SearchBuilder->Count to do the right thing if no 
          query has been performed
        - No longer specify a sort order if no sort order was specified ;)
